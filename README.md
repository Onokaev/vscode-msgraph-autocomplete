# MS Graph Completion

This VSCode extension allows you to auto-complete the Microsoft Graph API URLs you are writing. You get the most useful Microsoft Graph Explorer functionality in your favorite editor.

> **Info**: The extension does this with the help of the APIs behind the Microsoft Graph Explorer.

## Usage

Start typing `https://graph.microsoft.com/`, and you will automatically get suggestions to autocomplete the URL with API paths, query string parameters, and values.

### Commands

#### MS Graph: Clear autocomplete cache

By default, the cached data persists for 5 days. If you want, you can always clear the cache by using the *MS Graph: Clear autocomplete cache* (`msgraph.autocomplete.clearCache`) command.
